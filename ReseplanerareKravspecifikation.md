# Requirements Specification for Simple Travel Planner

## Description
The Simple Travel Planner is a single-page application (SPA) developed using React and Next.js. It allows users to create, view, and manage travel plans with ease. This application aims to provide a user-friendly interface to organize trips including destinations, travel periods, and planned activities for each destination.

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication:
- Users can register, log in, and log out.
- User sessions are managed securely.

### Travel Plans Management:
- Users can create new travel plans with details such as destination, dates, and activities.
- Users can view a list of all their travel plans.
- Users can edit and delete existing travel plans.

### Destination Management:
- Users can add destinations to a travel plan.
- Users can modify and delete destinations within a travel plan.

### Activity Management:
- Users can add planned activities for each destination.
- Users can modify and delete activities.

### Data Persistence:
- Ensure that travel plans, destinations, and activities are saved across sessions.

## Client-side Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: Used to store user session data and basic profile settings.
- **IndexedDB**: Used for storing structured travel plans, including details of destinations and activities due to its ability to handle large amounts of structured data.

## Running the Application Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the application using `npm run dev`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Challenges and Resolutions
### Challenge: Difficulty in managing state across components.
- **Resolution**: Implemented Redux for global state management, simplifying the flow of data.

### Challenge: Issues with IndexedDB API complexity.
- **Resolution**: Utilized a wrapper library to simplify IndexedDB operations, improving data handling efficiency.
